# BE 544 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Techniques in Digital Histopathology (Summer 2024)

Welcome to the BE 544: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Techniques in Digital Histopathology course.

This course offers both theoretical and practical knowledge about computer vision and AI techniques essential for
processing and analyzing microscopic images, contributing to the shift towards digital pathology. This transition will
allow AI models to assist pathologists and healthcare professionals in managing and diagnosing various diseases.

We'll explore how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing bioengineering, particularly in analyzing and
interpreting digital pathology images. Join us as we uncover the latest advancements and methodologies in this exciting
intersection of technology and healthcare. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about the future of
healthcare technology, this playlist offers valuable insights into the innovative applications of AI in digital
histopathology.
